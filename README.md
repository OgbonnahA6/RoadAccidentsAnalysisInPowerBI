# Road Accidents Analysis In PowerBI

## Road Accidents Analysis Report
________________________________________
### Executive Summary
- The Road Accidents Analysis reveals a decline in overall accidents and casualties, reflecting progress in road safety measures. Key findings indicate that while total accidents have decreased by 11.7%, slight accidents remain the most frequent type, accounting for over 86% of incidents. Cars dominate as the primary vehicle type involved, and single carriageways contribute the most accidents by road type. Fatalities have seen a significant reduction of 35.6%, but urban areas remain hotspots for incidents, particularly on Fridays. This report provides professional insights and actionable recommendations to address critical issues and sustain safety improvements.

### 1. Key Metrics and Trends
- **Accident and Casualty Statistics**
  - Total Accidents (2022): 144.4K (-11.7% YoY).
  - Slight Accidents: 124.1K (-10.8% YoY).
  - Serious Accidents: 18.8K (-14.5% YoY).
  - Fatal Accidents: 1.5K (-35.6% YoY).
  - Total Casualties (2022): 195.7K (-11.9% YoY).
- **Insights:**
1.	Decline in Fatalities: The significant reduction in fatal accidents reflects improved emergency response, awareness campaigns, and vehicle safety advancements.
2.	High Volume of Slight Accidents: Slight accidents dominate, posing persistent resource allocation challenges for traffic management and emergency services.
Recommendations:
•	Continuing Fatality Reduction Efforts: Invest in advanced emergency response systems and collision prevention technologies.
•	Address Frequent Minor Accidents: Deploy campaigns targeting distracted driving and improving traffic signage.

2. Accident Trends by Vehicle Type
Top Involved Vehicles
•	Cars: 155.8K accidents, accounting for 75% of incidents.
•	Vans: 15.9K accidents, significant among commercial vehicles.
•	Bikes: 15.6K accidents, reflecting high vulnerability.
•	Buses: 6.6K accidents, moderate but notable risk.
Insights:
1.	Car Dominance: Cars overwhelmingly contribute to accidents, likely due to their volume and high reliance in urban areas.
2.	Bike and Van Vulnerability: Bikes and vans highlight infrastructure and regulatory gaps in urban and suburban environments.
Recommendations:
•	Car-Focused Interventions: Promote advanced safety features (e.g., adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist).
•	Bike Safety Enhancements: Build dedicated bike lanes and enforce helmet laws.
•	Commercial Driver Regulation: Implement mandatory training for van drivers and monitor speeds in high-density areas.

3. Accident Trends by Road Type
Road Type Contributions
•	Single Carriageways: 92K accidents, the highest risk type.
•	Dual Carriageways: 19K accidents, less frequent but still significant.
•	Roundabouts: 9K accidents, reflecting potential design issues.
•	Slip Roads and One-Way Streets: 2K accidents each showing localized risks.
Insights:
1.	Single Carriageways: High congestion, overtaking behaviors, and pedestrian interactions increase risks.
2.	Roundabout Risks: Accidents at roundabouts suggest design inefficiencies or driver confusion.
Recommendations:
•	Single Carriageway Safety: Install speed cameras, improve pedestrian crossings, and limit overtaking zones.
•	Roundabout Redesign: Use clear lane markings and install yield signs to improve navigation.
•	Slip Roads: Enhance merging lane lengths and visibility for safer transitions.

4. Temporal Trends and Patterns
Seasonal and Weekly Patterns
•	Monthly Trends:
o	Accidents peak during warmer months (e.g., July 2021: 164K accidents).
o	Declines are notable toward the year-end, likely reflecting seasonal behavior changes.
•	Day of the Week:
o	Fridays: 24K accidents, consistently the most hazardous day.
o	Sundays: 16K accidents, the least hazardous.
Insights:
1.	Seasonality Impacts: Warmer months see spikes due to increased travel and outdoor activities.
2.	Friday Peaks: End-of-week congestion and fatigue contribute to higher accident rates.
Recommendations:
•	Seasonal Campaigns: Deploy enforcement and awareness campaigns during high-risk months.
•	Friday Interventions: Introduce traffic monitoring and policing during peak hours.

5. Junction Control Analysis
Junction Data Breakdown
•	Give Way: 70.9K accidents, the highest among junction types.
•	Signal-Controlled Intersections: 15.6K accidents, reflecting moderate risks.
•	Uncontrolled Junctions: 10.4K accidents, showing safety gaps.
•	Data Missing: 46.5K accidents, indicating incomplete reporting.
Insights:
1.	Give Way Risks: High accident rates suggest poor design or lack of driver understanding.
2.	Data Gaps: Missing data highlights the need for standardized reporting systems.
Recommendations:
•	Junction Improvements: Redesign Give Way intersections with clearer signage and advanced warnings.
•	Standardized Data Collection: Mandate detailed reporting at accident sites to improve analysis.

6. Casualty Breakdown by Urban vs. Rural
•	Urban Areas: 61.9% of casualties occur in urban zones.
•	Rural Areas: 38.1%, reflecting lower volumes but higher fatality risks.
Insights:
•	Urban Challenges: Traffic density and pedestrian interactions elevate accident risks in urban zones.
•	Rural Fatality Risks: Sparse emergency response and higher speeds increase rural fatality rates.
Recommendations:
•	Urban Safety: Expand pedestrian zones and implement congestion pricing to manage traffic.
•	Rural Response: Improve road lighting, signage, and emergency response infrastructure.

7. Recommendations Summary
Short-Term (0–3 Months)
1.	Deploy awareness campaigns targeting distracted driving and speed violations.
2.	Focus on redesigning high-risk junctions (e.g., Give Way intersections).
3.	Enhance police presence during peak accident times (e.g., Fridays).
Medium-Term (3–6 Months)
1.	Expand bike lanes and pedestrian crossings in urban areas.
2.	Improve reporting systems to capture complete junction and road data.
3.	Introduce seasonal accident mitigation strategies (e.g., summer travel campaigns).
Long-Term (6–12 Months)
1.	Develop predictive analytics systems to forecast high-risk periods and locations.
2.	Redesign single carriageways with safer infrastructure (e.g., overtaking restrictions).
3.	Collaborate with urban planners to implement smart city technologies for traffic management.
